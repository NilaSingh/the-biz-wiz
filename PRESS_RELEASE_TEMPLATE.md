## Heading ##
  Small business marketing and consultation forum

## Sub-Heading ##
  A space for small/local shops to exchange insight pertaining to the success of their products while marketing themselves. 

## Summary ##
  This product offers a forum for small businesses to exchange ideas while marketing themselves to other users. Business accounts are able to create posts that speak about anything pertaining to their success as a shop. This includes where they buy their wholesale items or how they develop their products. This helps other businesses grow and develop their own products. Meanwhile, individual accounts are able to find small businesses that relate to their specific needs. This application makes it possible for previously failing or new businesses to improve themselves by exchanging techniques and tips while expanding their reach to a variety of new customers.

## Problem ##
  During Covid many people have lost their only means of making an income. Due to this, they have turned to entrepreneurship. However, many have no idea where to start and often end up investing in products that are detrimental to their business. Others struggle with marketing and end up having to shut down shop due to a lack of customers. This results in a large number of people who are struggling financially that must rely on their own skills/crafts to make a living.

## Solution ##
  To solve this issue, this application allows small business owners to share their secrets from where they buy their packaging to step by step instructions on how they create/market their products. Additionally, it allows individuals to find and support small businesses such as a local farmers market, a new cosmetics brand and many more. As a result, not only will businesses benefit and grow but they will be able to market themselves and achieve a higher chance at succeeding in their industry.

## Key Technical Challenge ##
  The most challenging hurdle for this project will be developing separate functionalities for generic user and business accounts. Each will have differing abilities that may result in a very intricate design.

## Extension Opportunities ##
  This application can be further expanded by including screening/authentication processes to limit the amount of fake business accounts and prevent fraud. Businesses could also earn online awards for successfully proving their legitimacy by providing items to verify health inspection ratings, vegan ingredients and many more. This feature is beneficial to individual accounts so that they can shop in confidence.
